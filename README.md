## About me :
I'm a 22-years-old French student from La Plateforme_ in Marseille. I would like to become a Software Developer.
I'm teaching myself programming languages I don't use with school. Even if I'm an independent person, I enjoy develop projects with a team. You can find some of my projects on this GitHub account.
